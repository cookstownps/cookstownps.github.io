	<p>Hi, my name is Jeff Jeffers! I am 20 years old. I have came here today to tell you about the footman’s job!<br> I started this job when I was 16 years old! Every day I have to wake up at 7am, t’was hard<br> at the start but you get settled in pretty fast!</p>
	    
	<p>	The master is one rich man! He doesn’t know what to do with all his money! Every day I<br>have to wait the table for Mr.McGeogh-Bond and his wife. Also I have to polish boots for the master.</p>
	<p>	I started at garden hand but the butler saw me hard working so I got a promotion! I have to<br> clean cutlery and supply the fires with coal! I really enjoy my job. I have to pay my family to help<br> them get food on the table!</p>
	<p>	I come from a small village in Cookstown, I have 2 sisters and 1 brother, Alexander, Bell<br> and Matt. My mother is called Anne my dad is called Jeffery.<br> Home was hard work, to get food on the<br> table, it was extremely hard! My dad owns a farm and we get milk from cows, he was one hard<br> working fella!</p>
